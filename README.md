# Co-Lab

## What is Co-Lab?
Online Lab where students can join a chat and collaborate together on a whiteboard setup created using a canvas in HTML and ran on a node.js backend with client synchronization done with websockets via socket.io. Website linked is the drawing aspect which is currently being used by fellow colleagues.
See a demo of the drawing aspect hosted [here](http://www.drawcanvas.cloudno.de/):

## Setup
Run npm install in both drawing/ and chat/ with their own terminal windows

Start both of the servers, "node client.js" and "npm start" respectively

Open main.html to get the collab work page
